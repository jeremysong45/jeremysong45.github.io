    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>  Hi! I’m Jeremy Song, a student at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. My journey into the world of fine dining began in July 2021, when I visited Kochi, a Michelin-starred Korean restaurant in New York City. 
      At the time, I don't think I fully appreciated the creativity and storytelling behind the meal ~ but it left enough of an impression to stick with me.</p>

    <p>  Three years later, in July 2024, I gave fine dining another try at Jua, another Korean Michelin-starred spot. This time, it all clicked. </p>
    <p>  I'm not a chef or critic, just someone who enjoys food.</p>
    <p>  Enjoy.</p>
