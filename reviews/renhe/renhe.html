    <h2>Review Summary</h2>
    <p>Renhe Restaurant impressed me with its modern take on regional Chinese flavors. The tasting menu included intricate textures and artful plating without feeling overly conceptual. The standout dish was a braised abalone with sea cucumber in a rich mushroom broth—perfectly executed.</p>

    <h2>Ambiance</h2>
    <p>The space was elegant but not stiff—warm lighting, understated decor, and very attentive service without being invasive.</p>

    <h2>Would I Return?</h2>
    <p>Absolutely. It’s a gem in Shanghai’s fine dining scene that I think deserves even more attention internationally.</p>
